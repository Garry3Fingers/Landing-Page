        <p>
          Yoga, an ancient practice and meditation, has become increasingly popular in today's busy society. For many people, yoga
          provides a retreat from their chaotic and busy lives. This is true whether you're practicing downward facing dog posture
          on a mat in your bedroom, in an ashram in India or even in New York City's Times Square. Yoga provides many other mental
          and physical benefits. Some of these extend to the kitchen table.
